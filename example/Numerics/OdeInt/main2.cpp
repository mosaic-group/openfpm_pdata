 * We can use the Odeint library from boost in two ways. The first example will cover a simple case where we control the time stepping ourselves (time loop of the simulation wriiten by us).
 * The 2nd Example will cover a way of using odeint where the time is forwarded by odeint along with a observer.
 *
 *  * In each of these examples, we solve the follwing advection-diffusion pde for two chemicals with concentration @f[\vec(C)=(C_1,C_2)@f] with a fixed velocity @f[\vec(V)=(-y*e^{10*(x^2+y^2)},x*e^{10*(x^2+y^2)})@f]
 *
 * @f[ \frac{\partial\vec{C}}{dt}=\vec{V}.\nabla U + 0.1*\Delta U @f]
 * in 2d domain [-1,-1]*[1,1] with the boundary conditions on the walls as no-slip for velocity V=0 and sink for the chemicals U=0.

 * *
 * In this example, we perform time integration in a 2d domain of particles of a following partial differential equation:
 *
 * @f[ \frac{\partial\vec{C}}{dt}=\vec{V}.\nabla U + 0.1*\Delta U @f]
 * in 2d domain [-1,-1]*[1,1] with the boundary conditions on the walls as no-slip for velocity @f[\vec{V}=0@f] and sink for the chemicals @f[\vec{C}=0@f].
 *
 * We do that by emplying a Lagrangian frame of reference. Hence the Pde is transformed to:
 *
 * @f[\begin{cases}
 *   \frac{\partial\vec{X}}{dt}=\vec{V}\\
 *   \frac{\partial\vec{C}}{dt}=0.1*\Delta U
 * \end{cases} @f]
 * This is a system of PDEs. We decouple the moving of the particles from the evolution of the chemicals as it can be expensive to recompute derivatives at every stage of a time integrator in a single step.
 *
 * Output:
 * 1.) Time series data of the PDE Solution.

 * ## Creating the Observer Functor## {#ode_c_obs}
 *
 * There are multiple ways in which the system can be integrated. For example, and ideally, we could put both the PDEs into the RHS functor (Moving the particles at every stage). This can be expensive.
 * However, Often in numerical simulations, Both the PDEs can be integrated with seperate steppers.
 * To achieve this we will use the observer functor.
 * The observer functor is called before every time step evolution by odeint. Hence we can use it to update the position of the particles, with an euler step. and also update the operators and write/observe the solution.
 *
 * Now we create the Observer functor. Please refer to ODE_int for more detials.
 * Note that we have templated it with two operator types DXX and DYY again. But we never use them. It is just an example to show how versatile the observer can be.
 *
 * All Observer computations  needs to happen in the operator ().
 * Odeint expects the arguments here to be an input state_type X, and time t.
 * We pass on the openfpm distributed state types as
 * void operator()( const state_type_2d_ofp &X , const double t ) const
 *
 * Since we would like to use again openfpm here. We cast back the global pointers created before to access the Openfpm distributed vector here.
