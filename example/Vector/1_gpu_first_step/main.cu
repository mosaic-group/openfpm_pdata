 *
 *
 * This example shows how to use GPUs in OpenFPM step by step. To start to use GPUs with vectors_dist, this example is a good
 * starting point. On the other hand we suggest to read the example \ref{simple_vector_example} before this example.
 *
 * ## Data structures {#GPU_data_structures}
 *
 * While a cpu data-structure can be created with vector_dist a gpu data-structure can be created with vector_dist_gpu.
 * The GPU vector_dist expose the same CPU interface with additional functionalities. This means that a vector_dist can be
 * changed to vector_dist_gpu without changing a single line of code. This is an important feature because give us the possibility
 * to change our code from CPU to GPU incrementally step-by-step. A small sections of code can be moved to GPU leaving the rest
 * unchanged. The documentation of vector_dist_gpu is the same ad vector_dist, the extended functionality is documented in
 * vector_dist. Every file containing vector_dist_gpu must be compiled with nvcc compiler, so we suggest to use the extension
 * *.cu for such files and add a rule to compile cu files using nvcc. An example of how to do it can be seen checking the Makefile
 * in this example.
 *
 * While changing from vector_dist to vector_dist_gpu, seem not producing any effect. There are some underling change that take
 * effect:
 *
 * * The internal memory used to allocate memory is not anymore simple heap memory, but is CUDA pinned host memory.
 * * Buffers are allocated for each property.
 * * Vector properties like float[3] and float[3][3] has a different layout in memory from the standard (It will be
 *   clear how and why later in the example)
 *
 * This code snippet below shows how vector_dist_gpu can be used like vector_dist in \ref{simple_vector_example}.
 * In short we create a set of 100 particles (vector_dist_gpu) in 2d from {0.0,0.0} to {1.0,1.0}. Particles are
 * randomly placed in such space. The final map redistribute such particles accordingly to the decomposition.
 *

 *
 * ### Offload data to GPU ###
 *
 * To offload data to GPU you can use the function hostToDevicePos to offload particle position and hostToDeviceProp to offload
 * properties data. This latest function take template parameters to specify which properties to offload. Here we offload all
 *  the properties (scalar,vector,tensor)
 *
 * \snippet Vector/1_gpu_first_step/main.cu offload_pos_prop
 *
 * Once the data has been offload we can launch a kernel to do some computation. All data-structure gpu ready has a function
 * called toKernel that give the possibility to pass the data-structure to the kernel and be used inside the kernel, like is
 *  used on CPU. Lanuching a kernel on cuda require the subdivision of of a loop in workgroups and threads in the workgroups.
 *  OpenFPM provides the function getDomainIteratorGPU to automatically split the domain particle loop. The members wthr and
 *  thr can be used in the <<<...>>> brachet to launch a CUDA kernel.
 *
 * \snippet Vector/1_gpu_first_step/main.cu launch_domain_it
 *
 * The kernel is the definition of a normal CUDA kernel. We use template parameters for every parameter that is passed with toKernel()
 *
 * \note The definition of the arguments toKernel() as template parameter give us the possibility to use the template engine
 *       to do type deduction and avoid to specify the real-type returned by toKernel()
 *
 * The kernel simply shift the particles by 0.05. Set the scalar properties to the sum of x and y of the "old" particle position,
 * set the vector properties to the old particle position, and set the tensor to several combination of x and y "old" particle
 * position
 *
 * \snippet Vector/1_gpu_first_step/main.cu kernel_translate_fill_prop
 *
 * Once the computation is completed we can ask to reoffload the data from device to host and write the results to file.
 *
 * \note Every file writer requires that the data are offloaded on host memory
 *

 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * ## map and ghost_get for multi GPU
 *
 * Until here we saw how to move data from host to device, device to host and how to launch a CUDA kernel on off-loaded data.
 * As previously mentioned vector_dist_gpu has the same CPU interface and so provide the standard function map and ghost_get that work
 * on host pinned memory. Because we want to avoid to move data from GPU to host memory. To avoid it we can use map with the option
 * RUN_DEVICE to redistribute the particles directly on GPU, and ghost_get with RUN_DEVICE to fill ghost particles directly on GPU.
 * In the loop below we see how we can use map on a particle set that is already on GPU. In particular we never offload particles on CPU
 * to do map or ghost_get. We use the kernel translate_fill_prop, to translate the particles and update the properties. The only offload
 * happen every 10 time-step to write on file.
 *
 * \snippet Vector/1_gpu_first_step/main.cu map_and_ghost_get_on_gpu
 *
 * ## RDMA on MPI with CUDA
 *
 * Today MPI implementations are able to do RDMA on GPU memory. This in practice mean that Infiniband card can directly read
 * GPU memory transfer over infiniband and write on the other node directly on GPU, without moving the data to system memory.
 * In practice means that MPI calls can work directly on CUDA device pointers. OpenFPM can exploit this feature if MPI is compiled
 * with CUDA support. To check if MPI is compiled with CUDA support use the function \b is_mpi_rdma_cuda_active() \b
 *
 * \snippet Vector/1_gpu_first_step/main.cu performance_rdma
 *
 * It is good to note that in order to work (return true), some condition must be met.
 *
 * * Because at the moment OpenFPM sense OpenMPI CUDA aware implementation we must define the \b OPENMPI \b macro
 *   \snippet Vector/1_gpu_first_step/main.cu using_openmpi
 *
 * * MPI must be compiled with CUDA support (in general installing OpenFPM with -g should attempt to install OpenMPI with CUDA support)
