# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.0.0] September 2021 (Codename )

- Adding DCPSE, Level-set based numerics (Closest-point)

### Changes

- Particles writer use now the new XML pvtp Paraview format
- Particles constructor does not accept discordance precision on space example:
            If I create a Particle set with vector_dist<3,double,.......>
            I MUST give in the constructor a domain Box<3,double> and a Ghost<3,double>, giving a Ghost<3,float> will produce
            an error

## [3.3.0] April 2021 (Codename Vega)

- Adding support for HIP and AMD GPU. (Only particles) 1_gpu_first/7_sph_dlb_gpu/7_sph_dlb_gpu_opt are compatible with HIP
Additional Notes:
- WARNING: AMD GPUs are tested manually and not in CI. This mean that out this release stuff can break at least
           until I do not convince my working place to buy one for me ... and is gonna be hard because or rule here and there ... or who 
           is reading this message does not want to buy one for me :-)
- SparseGridGPU are unsupported untill AMD does not fix the bug reported here:
           https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/issues/2260

### Changes

- None

### Fixed

- uninitialized variables in the SPH example on GPU, and other fixes necessary for AMD gpus

## [3.2.0] January 2021 (Codename Hopper)

- Adding CUDA_ON_CPU option to run CUDA code on CPU
- Adding gdb-gui debugger

### Fixed

- Minors bugs

### Changes

- In order to compile OpenFPM is now required a compiler implementing C++14 Standard

## [3.1.0] October 2020 (Codename New Horizons)

## [1.X ] End of life (Theese versions are not enymore supported)

## [2.0.0] February 2019 (Codename Elisa)

### Added

- Adding GPU support (see example 1_gpu_first_step
				  3_molecular_dynamic_gpu 
                                  7_sph_dlb_gpu

### Fixed 

- Detection of clang 10.0.0 on mac-osx mojave
- In VTK binary format all 64 bit types are casted to 32 bit. Either the long/unsigned_long are bugged in Paraview we tested, either I do not understand how they work.

### Changed

- The type Vcluster now is templated and the standard Vcluster is Vcluster<>
           Most probably you have to change in your code from Vcluster to Vcluster<>
